#Prescale merging code
This code will be used to determine the minBias muon-tagged trigger-on jet spectra from a sample with different prescales.
In pp MinBias, the HLT_HIL3Mu5_NHitQ10_v1 trigger is prescaled with values of 1,3,and 5. 
Requires 3 skims of minBias data:
- Only events with prescale = 1
- Only events with prescale = 3
- Only events with prescale = 5
